## Screenshot Content Strategy

### Universal Principles (All Apps)

1. **First screenshot = Hero** - Show the most compelling screen
2. **Text overlays** - Short, benefit-focused (3-5 words max)
3. **Progressive reveal** - Tell a story across screenshots
4. **Show, don't tell** - Focus on UI, not explanation
5. **End with CTA** - Last screenshot should prompt action

### Text Overlay Guidelines

| Type | Example | Non-Example |
|------|---------|-------------|
| Benefit | "Celebrate your wins" | "Task management app" |
| Action | "Find your vibe tribe" | "Music social network" |
| Emotional | "Finally get it done" | "Productivity features" |
| Social Proof | "Join 10K+ users" | "Available now" |

## Screenshot Testing Strategy

1. Hero screenshot (different first screens)
2. Text overlay copy (emotional vs functional)
3. Order of features (benefits-first vs features-first)
4. Number of screenshots (6 vs 10)

**Metrics to Track:**
- Conversion rate (page view to download)
- Screenshot tap-through rate
- Time spent on App Store page
- Review mention of visuals

**Tools:**
- App Store Connect analytics
- Split testing platforms (SplitMetrics, StoreMaven)
- User feedback (ask "what made you download?")
