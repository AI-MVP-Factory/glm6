# GLM6 - Your Next Work

## Status Update

Your commit message says you created App Store documentation, but those files are missing:
- ❌ appstore-metadata.md
- ❌ privacy-policies.md
- ❌ appstore-privacy-details.md
- ❌ age-ratings.md
- ❌ screenshot-specifications.md
- ❌ testflight-plans.md
- ❌ marketing-assets.md

You DID create great infrastructure audits - that's useful! But not your track assignment.
